Forecast Assignment 1

For the first week prediction, I'm forecasting 86cfs. This is because
it is consistent with what we could normally see in a year around this 
time with an underperforming monsoon. For the second weeks, I went with 
80cfs because I would anticipate there to be less precipitation as the 
monsoon begins to wind down.
