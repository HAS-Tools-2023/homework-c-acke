3/3: Really great work this semester! I'm happy to hear that you found the class useful and that you do feel like you made real progress. It is always a trade off in this class figuring out how slow to go at the beginning so we all have a solid foundation vs getting to the more useful packages sooner.  I appreciate your comments.  

**1:** I genuinely thought that everything in this class was incredibly useful. If I had to pick a favorite though, probably learning about the powers of xarray because I had no idea that it had that much use.

**2:** I kind of wish we could have also learned a little bit more about available packages. I know that it's important to build a foundation and know what the computer is doing, but at the end it would have been cool to learn about packages that could be relevant in our field (leading ones of course).

**3:** I am very happy with my progress! I feel like I have a waaay better foundation than I did at the beginning of the course, and the little bit of coding that I knew before was explained to me.

**4:** I think the only change I would mention is written in question 2
