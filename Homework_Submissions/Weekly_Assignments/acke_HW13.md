9/9: 
Really nice work! Your code is much easier to follow this time and the documentation for your functions is excellent.  I am not sure exactly why it was giving you a subscriptable error but I would say that your use of the linter did make it generally much cleaner and easier to follow. Its okay with me if you don't listen to it 100% of the time it can give some erroneous suggestions. 

I left you some comments in your script just for future reference. 

**Forecast:** My week one forecast this week is 204cfs, and my week two forecast is 226.6cfs.


**Comments:** This assignment was definitely a challenge, but I feel like I learned a lot. Many of my remaining questions seem to stem from formatting questions. I did try and get rid of the whitespace convention error on line 46 but no matter how many times I erase it, it does not go away. I am also confused as to what constant function names need to be capitalized. For example, it popped a flag on some, but not others. For my 'forecast' function, it says it should be capitalized, but I'm not sure why since it doesn't ask for other functions that are very similar to be capitalized. 

Also, despite a lot of research, I can't figure out what unsubscriptable object means, and why it shows in the linter on line 130 where I am concatenating values into one column in order to plot.
