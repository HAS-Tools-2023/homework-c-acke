**Forecast** 
My forecast for week one is 132.34, and my forecast for week two is 137.87.

**1:** I created this forecast by taking the mean of all historical values for the dates in week one and in week two, then subtracting 50 because we are lower than average with rainfall.

**2:** This week, I added a function that can find the mean of a dataframe. I wanted to make a function that could create a function that pull flow values over a week period when the timeperiod is over two different months, so then two different indices.

**3:** I like to do a lot of means, and it may be easier to do a function if we want to mean an isolated row or dataframe.

**4. Remaining questions:** I have a few questions about the linting process because some of the things that I got don't really make sense to me. How do I get rid of 'trailing whitespace' when using the linter? It comes up for my line 15. Also, does it matter how long my lines are if they are comments? I tend to write myself comments a lot for my future self so I don't forget things. Third, I'm confused by how my parenthesis in my return function are unnecessary because it says it is. Lastly, my two warnings are about an expression not being assigned to the print statements at the bottom and I didn't think that was required.
