Forecast 3

Forecast summary:
I went with 95cfs for the week 1 forecast. Because it's supposed to be generally dry for the next couple of weeks, I would expect the second week to be lower than the first. For the second week forcast, I went with 89cfs. This is because of the lack of rain. This is backed by about a 5% chance that it could be higher this time of year (see below). 

1. Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they? What data types are they composed of? How long are they? 

Flow is the measurement of how fast water is moving at the site. Years are the years of interest at the site. Month and day are the month and day of interest at the site. In terms of Python, they are all lists that contain integers. They are all 12668 indeses in length. 


2. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of 
times and as a percentage)?

For my first week's prediction, the daily flow was greater 676 times, or 5.34%. For my second week's prediction, the daily flow was greater 748 times, or 5.9%. 

3. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

For the first week's prediction, the daily flow was greater 302 times, or 2.38%. For the second week's prediction, the daily flow was greater 319 times, or 2.52%. 

4. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second? 

The first half of September seems to be generally lower than the second half.
