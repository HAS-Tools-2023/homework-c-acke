Forecast Assignment 2

I'm going to go with a forecast of 97cfs. From playing around with the 
data in Python, it seems as though we have been getting an increase of 
flow recently, along with some excess atmospheric moisture. For the 
second week, I'm forecasting 93cfs. From the plot I made, it seems like
the data oscillates, so streamflow should begin to decrease.
