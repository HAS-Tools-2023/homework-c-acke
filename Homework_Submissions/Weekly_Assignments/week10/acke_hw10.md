This week's exercises were overall really helpful. I feel like I learned more about writing functions and using them, but I still don't feel fully confident with them. I think for whatever reason I struggle with the generalization aspect of what you're feeding the initial argument. I was also stumped on the last question of Thursday's exercise. I remember you saying in class you wanted some shading between the max and min values (I think), but I don't really know how to do that fully. I have a rough idea from an exercise we did earlier in the matplotlib learning. The trickiest part about this for me would be how to create this from daily data. I'm not sure how to manipulate the data in such a way to plot this.
